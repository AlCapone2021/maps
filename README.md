Data source: Swiss Federal Office of Topography. [swissBOUNDARIES3D](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/landscape/swissBOUNDARIES3D.html).

ESRI Shapefiles
---------------

The ESRI Shapefiles are generated with [QGIS](http://qgis.org) using the 'V200' municipality area Shapefiles (QGIS wouldn't combine the cantons with the 'swissBOUNDARIES3D' files). Foreign municipalities are removed.
